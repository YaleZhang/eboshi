#Estimations
This file tracks differences between how long I thought it would take to perform a software development task and how long it actually takes.
Estimating how long it takes to build software is a critical skill that I wish to develop.

## Observations
I thought it would take 15 minutes to create an AWS account but instead it took 90.
I forgot that I needed do the following:
- Create a new Gmail account
- Create a new AWS account
- Create a new user account
- Create add credentials to terminal.

Update estimate for deploying chalice
Expectation: 5 min.
Reality: 2 hours
- I forgot that I needed to create a virtual environment, install dependencies, and make sure my AWS CLI would work. Changing estimate to 15 minutes.
- I forgot that the hardest thing about using Chalice is that it doesn't give you error when something isn't working. Instead, it just hangs.
